URLs to the load the UI page 
-----------------------------
http://localhost:8080/ --> it loads the frontend page where you can select source and destination planet

on submission, the URI /findshortestpath will be called and displays the result.

and there is Back button to resubmit the page with difference planets.

Adding Data into in H2 in memory DB
-- the data is loaded using Commandline runner for the three worksheets using the apache poi library
-- run the application either from within the IDE or using maven from the commandline using mvn clean install and check the
data on the following url: http://localhost:8080/h2
supply the following credentials: username: sa
                                  password:password
